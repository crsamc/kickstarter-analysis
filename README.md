# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project

### This project analyzed a dataset to see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Theater outcomes based on launch date showed that most launches were done in the months between May and August. May had the largest amount of launches at 166 overall with a 67% success rate, a 31% failure rate, and 2% canceled. December had the least amount of launches at 75 overall with a 49% success rate, 47% failure rate, and 4% canceled.

### Theater outcomes based on goals showed that most projects, at 534 overall, fell within a goal of 1000 to 4999. This range had a 73% success rate, 27% failure rate, and 0 cancellations. The least amount of projects, at 1 project overall, fell within a goal of 45000 to 49999 with 0% successful, 100% failure rate, and 0 cancellations.

## Results

1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   - Most prefer to launch during the summer. May and June had the most successful outcomes (67% and 65%)
   - There was quite a bit of a difference in the grand total when it came to each month but the percentages of success and failures didn't have a huge difference comparatively to their totals. 

2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   - Based on the data, the goals under 5000 had a higher success rate then the others. However, there isn't a steady decline in success with the increase of goal amounts. Therefore, I don't think the goal amount necessarily effects the success.

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
   - The campaigns were not all the same length. The longer campaigns had more of an opportunity to earn funding to reach their goals. Had they had the equal amounts of time, the data could be compared more on an even level.

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   - You could combine the two to take a look at launch date along side goals.
